This research develops a “Dynamic On-demand Infrastructure for Virtualized Client Equipment”, based on ETSI Network Function Virtualization (NFV) architecture, and conforms to BBF TR317 standard of Network Enhanced Residential Gateway (NERG). The containerized-base virtual customer premises equipment (vCPE) infrastructure leveraging Kubernetes and Software Define Network (SDN) to improve **availability**, **flexibility**, and **manageability**, achieving a **75%** reduction in hardware costs for telecom companies.
